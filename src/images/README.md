# Temp images

This is where all images should be saved. They will be optimised and added to the dist file after they have been saved here.

**Only add one image at a time**

# Usage

If browsersyn is running, images will automatically by optimised: 

**'gulp'**

If you wish to optisise a batch, stop browsersync and do a batch save:

**'gulp optimise-images'**
